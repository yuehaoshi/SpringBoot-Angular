# Definitions

Traditional Application:
Each user action results in a full HTML page load

Single Page Application
Partial Update instead of full page load on user actions, e.g. google maps, gmails

**Angular** is a framework for building modern single-page applications, e.g., Citi Bank, MSBox (www.madewithangular.com)

TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript and ECMAScript
Web Browser donot understand TS, need to use tsc to convert .ts to .js (tsc mydemo.ts), and then run js code through node (node mydemo.js)
Define Variables:
```typescript
let <variableName>: <type> = <initial value>;
let found: boolean = true;
```
